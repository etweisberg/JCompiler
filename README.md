# JCompiler

- implemented compiler for stack-based programming language using C
- implemented arithmetic operations
- implemented stack manipulation operations
- implemented if/else conditions using recursion to keep track of branching for nested if/else statements
  - works regardless of if has corresponding else
- implemented while loops using recursion to keep track of nested level
- implemented functions using sub-routines with stack frames
- succesfully compiled `prime.j`, which commonly does not function because of its size
  - required extremely concise and efficient assembly code to be outputted.
